# BracketValidation

This repository contains a Python script that checks if the brackets (parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces) in a given string are balanced. The script uses a recursive approach to validate the correctness of the brackets, ensuring that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order.

## Features
- **Multiple Bracket Types:** Supports `()`, `[]`, `{}`.
- **Nested Structures:** Handles nested and sequential bracket structures.
- **Non-Bracket Characters:** Ignores characters that are not brackets.
- **Comprehensive Validation:** Provides a clear result indicating whether the input string is balanced.

## Usage
- **Input:** Provide a string containing brackets.
- **Output:** The script returns `True` if the brackets are balanced and `False` otherwise.
